<H2>Assignment 1:<br/> </H2> 
For first few sessions I have tried to take you on a tour of the Khronos sponsored tutorial of "Hello Triangle."<br/>
The fairly high level of C++ sophistication and its 900+ lines of code makes this a very daunting challenge. <br/> 
There is no way to know what calls to make and in what order without the assistance of the group of engineers that created<br/>
the modern GPUs and this language. This is not easy stuff but this is were we are at in the high performance graphics world.<br/>
Welcome the complexity of Vulkan generated by the demands of of the gaming community, that's you all you people!<br/><br/><h4>

What you need to do is port the Vulkan tutorial from GLFW to SDL and get a triangle up. Let's make the due date next week. </h4> <br/>
If you have any technical savvy, you would have seen that the author of this website has posted<br/>
a github depository of the total source code of this first demo (and much more).<br/><br/>

The idea, my dear souls, is that you need to appreciate what this new system looks like and what needs to be set up.<br/>
This technology will change constantly over your careers, that I can guarantee! What I'm trying to help you with the skills<br/> 
to learn new things that will always be happening in our field. <br/><br/>

<H2>Assignment 2:<br/> </H2> 
Let's break up Assignment1 into a set of classes so we can manage things better. <br/>
If you are Using Vulkan in your capstone, choose whatever classes you wish - I will help if you if you  desire.<br/>
If you are in Shaked's class and want to put Vulkan in to her engine - Shaked and I will help (mostly me). <br/>
Else if none of the above ideas appeal to you, then build the classes based on my framework from OpenGl class - of course, I will help.<br/> 


<H2>Assignment 3:<br/> </H2> 
In this section you will need to see how the VBO (vertex buffer object) is set up and populated with data. It's the same long-winded stuff we have<br/>
seen before. By itself there's not much to see on the screen so we will also need to build a UBO (uniform buffer object). A zip link to my version of where
you should be at this point is posted on the right. There are also sample glsl shaders (source code). You will need to compile them manually.
