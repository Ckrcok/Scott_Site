It sounds like you will be covering a range of topics related to game development and game engines. Here is a brief overview of each of the topics you mentioned:

C++ Concurrency: This refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. This can be useful in game development for tasks such as loading assets or AI processing.

Memory monitoring: This involves tracking the amount of memory being used by a game or game engine and identifying areas where memory usage can be optimized.

Memory management: This involves techniques for efficiently allocating and deallocating memory within a game or game engine.

Game controllers: This refers to the use of input devices such as gamepads or joystick to control games.

Audio: This refers to the use of sound in games, including techniques for generating and manipulating sound effects and music.

GUI: This stands for "Graphical User Interface" and refers to the visual elements of a game or application that allow the user to interact with it, such as buttons and menus.

Frustum culling: This is a technique used in 3D graphics to improve rendering performance by only drawing objects that are within the field of view of the camera.

Renderer abstraction: This involves designing a game engine in such a way that the rendering subsystem can be easily swapped out or modified without affecting the rest of the engine.

Profiling: This involves measuring the performance of a game or game engine and identifying areas where performance can be improved.

Plug-ins: These are modular components that can be added to a game or game engine to extend its functionality.

DLLs: A DLL (Dynamic Link Library) is a library of code that can be loaded and executed at runtime. DLLs are often used in game development to allow code to be shared between multiple applications.

I hope this gives you a better understanding of the topics you will be covering in your course. Let me know if you have any other questions!
