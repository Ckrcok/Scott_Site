    <ul>
        <li>
            Topic 1 (max 10%): C++ Concurrency <i>(multi-threading)</i><br />
            For full credit, the secodary thread(s) must actually do something. If they share objects (memory), the use of mutexes must be looked at.<br />
            Some ideas are, but not limited to, load assets for a graphical game in a second thread, monitor XInput in a second thread, run a GUI interface in its own thread,
            monitor UDP network data... Be creative if you can, come on try.

            Topic 2 (max 10%): Memory Monitor<br />
            For full credit, keep track of all the heap allocations and deallocations by overloading the new and delete operators and gather data.
            Some ideas are, but not limited to, count the number of allocations and deallocations, sum the amount mem allocated and subtrack the amount deallocated lokking for memory leaks.
            Give me some stats.

            Topic 5 (10%): Audio <br />
            Creating audio without tools is very difficult and requires a knowledge of 3D-audio physics beyond the scope of out program.<br />
            Therefore, I recommend using a pre-made library:<br />
            <a href="https://https://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/"> IrrKlang </a> This is my favorite library. It's very complete, I'll demo it in class<br /><br />

            <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/"> SDL_mixer </a> This is a primitive audio library that cannot handle too many audio clips being played at the same time but it's easy to use and great for backgound music.As you may know, Limbo is my favorite
            video game from my grogramming and artistic perspective. I love the background music so much, I bought it, check it out in the panel on the right. <br /><br />

            <a href="https://www.openal.org/"> OpenAl - Open Audio Library </a> This offers more features than SDL_mixer. It is free and open source (and a little old) - I dare you to look into it. <br /><br />
            <a href="https://www.fmod.com/"> FMod - FMOD is a proprietary sound effects engine developed by Firelight Technologies </a> This is very much one of the standards in gaming. To download it you must register with them,
            to use it commercially, you must pay them. It is very complete for 3D sounds and music. It can hook into Unity, Unreal or in your stand-alone applications. Warning: it is a big API, there is a large learning curve associated with it. <br />
            Sorry, the video failed, there was no audio for the Audio class.<br /> <br />

            Topic 6 (10%): GUI build your own or use a pre-made tool kit.<br />

            If you are working in Vulkan: <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples/example_sdl_vulkan"> imgui for vulcan </a><br />
            If you are working in OpenGL: <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples/example_sdl_opengl3"> imgui for OpenGL </a><br />
            Another option is: <a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear"> The nuklear GUI system </a><br />

            Topic 7 (10%): Frustum Culling <br />
            In any graphics API, all the actors are passed into the shading pipeline. Vertex after vertex are transformed by the ProjectMatrix -> ViewMatrix ->
            ModelMatrix sequence forming primitives like triangles. At the end of all the calculations, if what you are drawing is outside of the window the data is
            clipped (just thown away).<br />
            What if you knew that Mario was behind you and not in front of the camera? You could save a lot of processing time by just not drawing Mario at all.
            This is the idea of frustrum culling. <br />

            Topic 8 (20% It's hard to do): Abstracting the Renderer <br />
            There are many renderering APIs out there: DirectX 11, DirectX 12, OpenGL and Vulkan. How do you choose what type of renderer you should use?
            That will be the subject of this talk. Maybe the best appoach is to abstract the renderer and we could use and choose any of them at start of runtime.<br />

        <li>
            Topic 9 (10%): Profiling Tools <br />
            Profiling tools are already installed since VS2019. Let me show you a little on geting started analyzing your C# or C++ code. Yup, I said C#.<br />
            There's technical publications from Microsoft out there on how to use their profiling (diagnostics report) tools but I find them unclear. There are a set
            of (pretty bad) videos from Microsoft on YouTube, but in my opinion, they talk a lot and say very little. Just skip to this link
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1-uHpEqNGM&list=PLReL099Y5nRf2cOurn1hI-gSRxsdbC27C&index=4">Profiling CPU usage</a> <br />
            Use these tools look at what your capstone is doing over time.<br />
            Another way to do timing is to do it yourself. In the online version of the class, I talked about std::chrono.
            Using this tool, you can create your own timing calls to evaluate the performance of your code. One member of out cohort, reminded me about a fun charactor on youtube.
            He has a game engine series, and I really love his work. I think he steals my good ideas. Ha! <br />
            This guy does a great job of creating some timer wrappers in this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbYV8rRo9_A">Intro to Profiling.</a>
            Warning this guy can really code.
            He uses STL a lot and invokes Lamba functions in his demo, I dare you to keep up with him. This ain't StackOverflow.<br />

        <li>
            Topic 10 (10%): Unreal, Unity Plug-ins and DLLs<br />
            Plug-ins are nothing more than a DLL written in C/C++ (unmanaged memory) or even C# (managed memory). <br />
            There are two parts the process (1) build the DLL and (2) create the C# script in Unity that uses it. <br />
            I'll show you how to create a dll in C/C++ in class, it's easy, but there is some explaining I must do.<br />
            A very good conference talk about DLLs was at CppCon 2017 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPQWQfDhICA">Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about DLLs</a><br />
    <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/NativePlugins.html">How to work with native plug-in in Unity</a> <br />
